# Evo: Architecture

## System Overview

Evo is designed as an agent-based system that facilitates secure communication and interaction between agents residing in different environments, or "planes." The core of the system is a Rust application that acts as a central hub, mediating communication between agents and enforcing security policies.

[Include a diagram here illustrating the interaction between the Rust core, browser extension, and different agent types]

**Key Components:**

* **Rust Core Application:**
    * Responsible for agent management, authentication, authorization, and secure communication.
    * Provides an API for agents to interact with each other and access resources.
    * Enforces access control policies and resource limits.
* **Browser Extension:**
    * Enables users to interact with Evo through a web browser.
    * Provides a user interface for managing agents, granting permissions, and initiating actions.
    * Acts as a bridge between browser-based agents and the Rust core.
* **Agents:**
    * Autonomous entities that can perform actions, access resources, and communicate with other agents.
    * Represented as identifiable sets of information with defined capabilities and access limits.
    * Can reside in different planes, such as the browser, local machine, or cloud.

## Agent Model

Evo's agent model is designed to be flexible and extensible, accommodating diverse agent types and capabilities.

* **Agent Types:**
    * Human: An individual user.
    * Browser Profile: A specific profile within a browser.
    * App Instance: An instance of an application running on a device.
    * Email Address/Inbox: An email address or inbox.
    * Website: A website or web application.
    * Physical Device: An IoT device.
    * Server: A server or cloud service.
    * Organization: A company or organization.
    * AI Agent: An AI-powered agent.
    * Hive Agent: A collective entity composed of multiple agents.
* **Agent Capabilities:**
    * Each agent has a defined set of capabilities, which are the actions it can perform.
    * Capabilities are expressed in a standardized format that enables interoperability between agents.
* **Agent Context:**
    * Each agent has a context, which is the information it has access to.
    * Context can include data, resources, and permissions.
* **Agent Communication:**
    * Agents communicate with each other through the Rust core application using a secure message-based protocol.
    * Messages can include requests for actions, data exchange, or notifications.

## Rust Core Application

The Rust core application is the central hub of the Evo system. It is responsible for:

* **Agent Management:** Registering, authenticating, and managing agents.
* **Access Control:** Enforcing access control policies based on agent identities and capabilities.
* **Secure Communication:** Providing secure communication channels between agents using encryption and authentication.
* **Resource Management:** Managing resource usage and enforcing quotas to prevent abuse.
* **API:** Exposing an API for agents to interact with the system and with each other.

## Browser Extension

The browser extension provides a user interface for interacting with Evo. It allows users to:

* **Manage Agents:** Create, configure, and manage agents.
* **Grant Permissions:** Grant permissions for agents to access resources and perform actions.
* **Initiate Actions:** Trigger actions on behalf of agents.
* **View Activity:** Monitor agent activity and logs.

## Communication Protocols

Evo utilizes secure communication protocols to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

* **HTTPS:** Used for communication between the browser extension and the Rust core application.
* **WebSockets:** Used for real-time communication between agents.
* **TLS:** Used for encryption and authentication.

## Security Considerations

Security is a primary concern in Evo's design.

* **Authentication:** Agents are authenticated using secure tokens or cryptographic keys.
* **Authorization:** Access control policies are enforced based on agent capabilities and user permissions.
* **Input Validation:** User inputs are validated to prevent malicious or unexpected behavior.
* **Sandboxing:** Agents can be sandboxed to limit their access to resources and prevent them from interfering with each other.

## Future Directions

* **Decentralization:** Explore decentralizing the Evo system to enhance privacy and resilience.
* **Advanced Agent Interactions:** Develop more sophisticated mechanisms for agent discovery, negotiation, and collaboration.
* **AI Integration:** Integrate AI agents to automate tasks and provide intelligent assistance.
* **Cross-Platform Expansion:** Expand support for different browsers and operating systems.
