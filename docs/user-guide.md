# Evo: Developer Guide

Welcome to the Evo developer guide! This guide provides information for developers who want to contribute to the Evo project.

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Install Rust:**
   - Follow the instructions on the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. **Clone the Evo Repository:**
   - `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/evo.git`

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the `evo` directory and run:
     ```bash
     cargo build
     ```

4. **Set up the Browser Extension Development Environment:**
   - Refer to the documentation for your specific browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) on how to set up an extension development environment.

## Coding Conventions

* Follow the Rust style guide: [https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html)
* Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
* Write comprehensive comments to explain your code.
* Use a consistent code formatting style.

## API Documentation

* **Rust Core API:**
   - The Rust core application exposes an API for agents to interact with the system.
   - API documentation can be found at [link to API documentation].

* **Browser Extension API:**
   - The browser extension provides an API for interacting with the Rust core and managing agents.
   - API documentation can be found at [link to API documentation].

## Testing Procedures

* **Unit Tests:**
   - Write unit tests for individual functions and modules.
   - Use the `cargo test` command to run unit tests.

* **Integration Tests:**
   - Write integration tests to test the interaction between different components of the system.

* **End-to-End Tests:**
   - Write end-to-end tests to test the entire system from the user's perspective.

## Contribution Guidelines

* **Bug Reports:**
   - Submit bug reports through the GitHub issue tracker: [link to issue tracker]
   - Provide detailed information about the bug, including steps to reproduce it.

* **Feature Requests:**
   - Submit feature requests through the GitHub issue tracker.
   - Explain the desired feature and its potential benefits.

* **Pull Requests:**
   - Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
   - Follow the coding conventions and testing procedures.
   - Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

## Community

* **Forums:**
   - Join the Evo community forums to discuss ideas, ask questions, and get help: [link to forums]

* **Chat:**
   - Join the Evo chat channel for real-time communication with other developers: [link to chat channel]

This `developer-guide.md` provides a starting point for developers who want to contribute to Evo. It covers development environment setup, coding conventions, API documentation, testing procedures, contribution guidelines, and community resources. As the project evolves, this guide can be expanded with more detailed information and specific instructions for different areas of the codebase.

Now, should we move on to the API Documentation (`api-documentation.md`)? This will likely be the most technically detailed document, and we can leverage tools like Doxygen or Swagger to help generate it from code comments.
