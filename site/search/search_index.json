[Include a diagram here illustrating the interaction between the Rust core, browser extension, and different agent types] Key Components: Rust Core Application: Responsible for agent management, authentication, authorization, and secure communication. Provides an API for agents to interact with each other and access resources. Enforces access control policies and resource limits. Browser Extension: Enables users to interact with Evo through a web browser. Provides a user interface for managing agents, granting permissions, and initiating actions. Acts as a bridge between browser-based agents and the Rust core. Agents: Autonomous entities that can perform actions, access resources, and communicate with other agents. Represented as identifiable sets of information with defined capabilities and access limits. Can reside in different planes, such as the browser, local machine, or cloud. Agent Model Evo's agent model is designed to be flexible and extensible, accommodating diverse agent types and capabilities. Agent Types: Human: An individual user. Browser Profile: A specific profile within a browser. App Instance: An instance of an application running on a device. Email Address/Inbox: An email address or inbox. Website: A website or web application. Physical Device: An IoT device. Server: A server or cloud service. Organization: A company or organization. AI Agent: An AI-powered agent. Hive Agent: A collective entity composed of multiple agents. Agent Capabilities: Each agent has a defined set of capabilities, which are the actions it can perform. Capabilities are expressed in a standardized format that enables interoperability between agents. Agent Context: Each agent has a context, which is the information it has access to. Context can include data, resources, and permissions. Agent Communication: Agents communicate with each other through the Rust core application using a secure message-based protocol. Messages can include requests for actions, data exchange, or notifications. Rust Core Application The Rust core application is the central hub of the Evo system. It is responsible for: Agent Management: Registering, authenticating, and managing agents. Access Control: Enforcing access control policies based on agent identities and capabilities. Secure Communication: Providing secure communication channels between agents using encryption and authentication. Resource Management: Managing resource usage and enforcing quotas to prevent abuse. API: Exposing an API for agents to interact with the system and with each other. Browser Extension The browser extension provides a user interface for interacting with Evo. It allows users to: Manage Agents: Create, configure, and manage agents. Grant Permissions: Grant permissions for agents to access resources and perform actions. Initiate Actions: Trigger actions on behalf of agents. View Activity: Monitor agent activity and logs. Communication Protocols Evo utilizes secure communication protocols to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. HTTPS: Used for communication between the browser extension and the Rust core application. WebSockets: Used for real-time communication between agents. TLS: Used for encryption and authentication. Security Considerations Security is a primary concern in Evo's design. Authentication: Agents are authenticated using secure tokens or cryptographic keys. Authorization: Access control policies are enforced based on agent capabilities and user permissions. Input Validation: User inputs are validated to prevent malicious or unexpected behavior. Sandboxing: Agents can be sandboxed to limit their access to resources and prevent them from interfering with each other. Future Directions Decentralization: Explore decentralizing the Evo system to enhance privacy and resilience. Advanced Agent Interactions: Develop more sophisticated mechanisms for agent discovery, negotiation, and collaboration. AI Integration: Integrate AI agents to automate tasks and provide intelligent assistance. Cross-Platform Expansion: Expand support for different browsers and operating systems.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#evo-architecture","text":"","title":"Evo: Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#system-overview","text":"Evo is designed as an agent-based system that facilitates secure communication and interaction between agents residing in different environments, or \"planes.\" The core of the system is a Rust application that acts as a central hub, mediating communication between agents and enforcing security policies.

Evo aims to be: A Universal Mediator: A secure and versatile platform that mediates communication and interaction between diverse agents, including humans, applications, devices, and AI. An Agent-Based Ecosystem: An ecosystem where agents can autonomously discover, connect, and collaborate with each other, fostering automation, personalization, and innovation. An Accessible Platform: A platform that empowers users with diverse abilities to interact with technology on their own terms, through custom interfaces and adaptive experiences. A Secure and Trustworthy System: A system that prioritizes security and privacy, protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access. Goals Develop a robust and secure core platform: Build a Rust-based core application that provides a secure and reliable foundation for agent communication and interaction. Create a flexible and extensible agent model: Define a versatile agent model that can accommodate diverse agent types and capabilities. Implement fine-grained access control: Enable users to define and manage access permissions for each agent, ensuring secure and controlled interactions. Foster agent discovery and connection: Develop mechanisms for agents to discover and connect with each other based on their capabilities and user preferences. Promote accessibility and inclusivity: Design the system to be accessible to users with diverse abilities, through alternative interfaces and adaptive experiences. Encourage community involvement: Build an open-source community around Evo, fostering collaboration, contribution, and innovation. Impact Evo has the potential to: Empower users: Give users greater control over their digital interactions and data. Improve accessibility: Make technology more accessible to people with diverse abilities. Foster innovation: Enable new forms of automation, collaboration, and personalization. Enhance security: Create a more secure and trustworthy digital environment. Promote interoperability: Break down barriers between different systems and platforms.
